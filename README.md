# Advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection Demo

## Description

This project is a simple web-based demonstration of credit card fraud detection techniques. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive form that checks for potential signs of fraud based on user input. This demo is for educational purposes only and should not be used as a real fraud detection system.

## Features

- Input validation for credit card numbers
- Detection of high-value transactions
- Basic IP address format checking
- Email address validation
- Comparison of shipping and billing addresses
- Flagging of bulk purchases
- User-friendly interface with color-coded results

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML file:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection-demo.git
   ```
   Or simply download the `fraud_detection_demo.html` file.

2. No additional installation is required as this is a standalone HTML file.

## Usage

1. Open the `fraud_detection_demo.html` file in a web browser.
2. Fill out the form with sample data:
   - Card Number: Enter a 16-digit number
   - Transaction Amount: Enter any number
   - IP Address: Enter an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
   - Email: Enter an email address
   - Shipping Address: Enter any address
   - Billing Address: Enter any address
   - Purchase Type: Select either "Single Item" or "Multiple of Same Item"
3. Click the "Check Transaction" button to see the results.
4. The result will be displayed at the bottom of the form, indicating whether the transaction appears legitimate or potentially fraudulent.

## How It Works

The demo uses JavaScript to perform several checks on the input data:

- Validates that the card number is 16 digits long and contains only numbers
- Flags transactions over 10,000 as potentially fraudulent
- Checks for a basic IP address format
- Looks for suspicious elements in the email address
- Compares shipping and billing addresses
- Flags purchases of multiple items as potentially suspicious

These checks are simplified for demonstration purposes and do not represent a comprehensive fraud detection system.

## Limitations

This demo is for educational purposes only and has several limitations:

- It does not actually process any payments or connect to any external systems
- The fraud detection rules are overly simplified
- There's no real security implemented for handling sensitive data
- The IP and email checks are very basic and not reliable for real-world use
